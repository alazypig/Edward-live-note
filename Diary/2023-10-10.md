Yesterday, I used code to automate the generation of store reports. What used to take a whole day can now be complete just half a day, greatly improving efficiency.

The Boss was very dissatisfied with Alibaba's official services because they didn't fulfill any of their promised commitments. The Boss was very angry and used harsh language.

The Boss had envisioned that after purchasing the services, there would be many major clients. In reality, most of the new clients were small in scale, and there were a lot of them.This led to an increase in workload, but the average profit actually decreased.

The abundance of small clients with complex customization requirements, chaotic warehousing, and schedule conflicts has made it clear that the Boss's investment of 100,000 RMB is destined to incur losses. Further more, there is a looming concern that even major clients might become unmanageable due to scheduling conflicts. This is a very concerning issues.
