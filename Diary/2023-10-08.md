This morning, my neck still hurts. I actually got a stiff neck after sleeping, and it's even worse now.

I don't want to go to work today, but my boss asked me to finish the tasks I couldn't complete yesterday.

I don't even know how to operate the machine. How am I supposed to complete the tasks?

I'll have to take it slow in the afternoon. It might take me the whole afternoon, and there might be a lot of waste produced.

I just can't understand why I always end up doing tasks that I have no prior experience with. These tasks often waste a lot of time and materials, and they seem completely unworthy of the effort I put in. I'm frequently troubled by such tasks, to the point where I strongly resist them.
