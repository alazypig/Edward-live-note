Last night i took some pics of the product to be used in the future, and i'm going to beautify them tonight.

And i twisted my neck talking to my wife last night.

My wife told me she took on new debt to pay off her debts. So now the total debt is over 20000.

I gave her 3000 to pay off her debt. Probably by the end of next year neither of us will have any extra money, and the marriage may not go ahead until the year after next year.

Anyway, for now, the debt is relatively small. The main source of the debt is from investment failures, so let's consider it as tuition paid to society.

Try to make money, try to find customers, and everything will be fine.

The weather has suddenly started to cool down. Take care of your health.
